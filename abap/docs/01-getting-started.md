# Getting Started

## Basics

The repository relies in Git and abapGit to coordinate, push and pull changes to the code between SAP & GitHub.

It uses abaplint and open-abap for code quality checks, linting, continous integration and unit tests.

GitHub Actions are used to trigger the automation scripts, continuous integration, automated code quality checks in combination with abaplint and opens up the possibility for a code review process with the team during pull requests, as the how the rest of engineering does.
